# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data


# Description:

In this project,I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.


# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1.Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.\
2.Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).\
3.Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.\
4.Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.\
5.Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.\
6.Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.\
